## Prologue

### (The Golden Days)

There are summers that stretch lazily across the skin like warm oil, heavy and sweet, promising nothing but rest. That summer, it was supposed to be such a time: a well-deserved escape, an amnesty from the quiet burdens that had, over the years, folded themselves into the creases of their marriage.

Southern France. A villa hidden among cypress trees and lavender fields, the sea not far beyond the hills, whispering promises on the salted wind. They had planned this journey for years, speaking of it in half-laughs over tired dinners, in whispered plans between deadlines and obligations. It was to be a second honeymoon, a tasting of the life they might one day claim when the heavy yoke of work was finally slipped from their necks.

They arrived, as one arrives at a dream half-remembered, half-hoped for — sunburned from travel, laughing too loudly at little things, clinging to each other against the shock of sudden freedom. She — radiant, blonde, her body still strong and supple in a way that seemed almost defiant of time — moved through the world like a woman reborn. He, a little slower, a little more careful, content to watch her joy unfurl.

The days spilled out golden before them: mornings thick with the scent of coffee and warm stone, afternoons spent wandering sun-drenched trails or lingering over endless lunches of fresh bread, olives, and ripe tomatoes, nights tangled in cotton sheets and whispered memories. They explored small villages where the streets were no more than crooked veins between crumbling houses, bought peaches so ripe they bled sugar down their wrists, and sat side by side at dusty cafés, drinking strong black coffee and sharing smiles too wide to hide.

And yet.

Beneath the surface of it all, like a slow tide pulling back from the shore, something stirred. An unease he could not name. It was in the way the heat clung too tightly to the skin; in the glances she returned, a little too long, a little too curious; in the strangers whose faces blurred together in the market crowds — save for one, who would not blur, who would remain.

Later, when he would lie awake in an unfamiliar bed, the shutters rattling against the mistral wind, he would wonder when it had begun. Whether the path had been laid before them long ago, paved not with decisions but with desires neither of them dared speak aloud. Whether it had been fate, or folly, that had brought them to that place, to that man, to that moment.

But for now, they only knew the sun was warm, and the days were theirs to squander.

They had no idea what they were about to lose.

## Chapter 1

### (The Town of Saint-Léon)

Saint-Léon was barely a town at all — more a collection of stone houses folded into the curves of the hills, their shutters faded by decades of sun and mistral wind. A single fountain, cracked and ancient, murmured in the square, its voice lost among the drifting scent of thyme and hot dust. Cats stretched languidly across the cobblestones. The café, the bakery, the grocer — all closed at noon, as if the town itself took a long, slow breath before the evening.

It was here they found themselves, hand in hand, laughing softly as they wandered through streets so narrow that the buildings seemed to lean together and whisper secrets above their heads.

For a time, it was enough. The rhythm of the days fell around them like an old, familiar song: mornings spent tangled in soft linen, afternoons exploring hidden gardens and sun-bleached chapels, evenings with the taste of fresh strawberries on their lips.

She was beautiful — no, more than beautiful. She was vivid. The sun had kissed her skin golden; the warmth had loosened something in her, something that had slept too long beneath the polite routines of everyday life. She dressed in airy skirts that floated around her thighs, blouses that clung lightly to her curves, sandals that laced high around her calves. She moved without thinking, without effort, and yet every glance she cast, every laugh that spilled from her lips, seemed charged with a new electricity.

He watched her often — quietly, reverently — as if afraid that if he spoke, he might break whatever spell had settled over her. He loved her, that much was certain. Loved her in the deep, anchoring way that only years can teach a man to love a woman: not with fireworks, but with tides.

And yet, somewhere in the spaces between their hands, between their glances, there stirred something more. A restlessness. A hunger. A part of her that was waking from a long, dreamless sleep, stretching herself towards the heat of possibility.

She did not yet know for what. Only that the world felt larger, more golden, more daring than it had in years. That for the first time in a long while, she was no longer only wife, no longer only careful and good and measured.

She was alive.

And the world, it seemed, was waiting.

## Chapter 2

### (The City and the Stranger)

By the fourth day, the quiet of Saint-Léon had begun to itch under her skin.

"Let's go to the city," she said that morning, her eyes alight with a mischievous spark. "I need a new dress. Something light. Something... special."

He smiled and agreed, delighted to see her so alive, so eager. They set off after breakfast, the car winding its way through hills striped with vineyards and olive groves, the sky a vast, aching blue.

The city — sprawling, golden, alive with voices and movement — wrapped itself around them at once. She drifted through the boutiques like a woman in a dream, her fingers trailing over silk and linen, pausing over delicate lace, soft leather, cool glass. She tried on dresses that clung to her body like whispered promises, spun for him in the fitting room doorways with a laugh that made heads turn.

A dress the color of old ivory. A pair of heels — slim, elegant, wicked. And then, with a blush and a teasing glance, a set of lingerie so delicate it might have been spun from the morning mist itself.

He watched her, heart heavy with wonder, thinking that he had never loved her more than in those hours: this woman who had shared his life, his burdens, his hopes — and who now seemed to be blooming before his very eyes, as if the years had been nothing more than a prologue to this moment.

When the bags were heavy in their arms and their feet tired from walking, they found a terrace tucked away from the main streets — a sleepy place where a few old men nursed tiny cups of coffee and no one hurried for anything.

They sat, the late afternoon sun casting honeyed light over the cracked tiles, the sound of a fountain murmuring somewhere nearby. She slipped off her sandals and curled her bare feet beneath her, laughing at something he said, her eyes bright, her skin glowing with life.

It was then that he noticed the man.

He had not been there a moment before — or perhaps he had, unnoticed among the shadows. He stood at the edge of the terrace, speaking briefly to the waiter, his voice low, his posture easy.

Older than them, but only just; his hair silver at the temples, his body broad and sure beneath a white linen shirt. His face, sun-kissed and marked by life, was handsome in a way that needed no apology, no artifice. There was an ease about him — a kind of practiced grace — that made him seem both out of place and entirely at home.

And then he looked at them.

No — not at them.
At her.

A glance that was not a glance, a gaze held just a moment longer than courtesy allowed, a small smile that hinted at something private, something meant for her alone.

It was over in a heartbeat. A polite nod, a murmured greeting to the terrace at large, and he took a seat two tables away, ordered a coffee, unfolded a newspaper as if the world were nothing but another warm afternoon.

But something had shifted.
The air, thick with sun and jasmine, seemed to hum against their skin.

Later, he would remember that look. That first, almost invisible look — as the moment the story began.

## Chapter 3

### (The Night She Glowed)

The drive back to Saint-Léon was slow and golden. The sun was sinking, drenching the hills in a molten light that seemed almost too rich to be real. They spoke little, each wrapped in the soft satisfaction of the day, her hand resting lightly on his thigh, her head turned towards the open window, letting the warm wind tangle her hair.

Dinner was simple — a table beneath a flowering vine, plates of grilled vegetables and fresh fish, the easy laughter of a few other diners floating on the breeze. She was radiant. He watched her from across the table, watched the way she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, the way her throat moved as she swallowed, the way her eyes caught the light and threw it back at him, mischievous and glowing.

Later, in their little villa, she disappeared into the bathroom with a playful smile.

"Wait for me," she said, her voice low, a thread of excitement woven through it.

He waited, heart thrumming with anticipation, listening to the faint sounds of rustling fabric, the muted click of heels against tile. When she emerged, he thought for a moment that he might be dreaming.

She wore the ivory dress — no, not the dress. The lingerie. A whisper of lace, soft as breath against her skin, delicate and sinful all at once. Her legs, long and strong, were made even more devastating by the slender heels she had laced high around her calves. She had darkened her eyes with makeup, touched her lips with a deep, forbidden red.

She did not walk to him.
She owned the room as she crossed it, slow, deliberate, every step a question and an answer all at once.

When she straddled him, her hands firm against his chest, her body supple and urgent, it was not the careful, familiar lovemaking of habit. It was something rawer, needier — a claiming. She kissed him with a hunger that left him gasping, whispered things against his ear that made him shudder. Her body moved against his in a rhythm that was hers alone, a dance of control and surrender, sweet and devastating.

He exploded into her with a helpless, blinding force, his hands clutching her hips, his heart hammering in his chest as she pressed her forehead against his, laughing breathlessly, riding the aftershocks of their shared release.

For a long time, they lay tangled together, slick with sweat, hearts slowly finding their rhythm again.

It was then, in the lazy, open honesty of the dark, that she spoke.

"That man," she murmured, tracing idle circles against his chest with her fingertip. "At the café."

He made a noise, not quite a question, still dazed.

"I wonder where he's from. Greece, maybe? Or Macedonia? Even Albania?" She laughed softly, a note of something — amusement, or curiosity, or something harder to name — in her voice.

He said nothing. He did not want to disturb the fragile peace of the moment.
But in his chest, a small, tight knot began to form.

She nestled closer, her breath warm against his skin. Within minutes, her breathing deepened, softened — sleep stealing over her like a tide.

He lay awake longer, staring at the dark ceiling, listening to the sigh of the night wind against the shutters.

Somewhere, not far away, a dog barked once, then fell silent.

And in the cool, sweet-smelling darkness, the seed of something dangerous began to grow.

## Chapter 4

### (The Dream that Began)

The next morning dawned brilliant and clear, the sky a vivid blue that seemed to hum with promise. The heavy warmth of summer had settled deeper into the hills, but in the city, among its shaded alleys and marble squares, there was a liveliness that called to them.

"Let's go back," she said over breakfast, her eyes bright, a playful tilt to her smile. "There are still shops I want to see. And the museum. They say it has a beautiful collection of old Provençal paintings."

He agreed at once. How could he not, when she was so full of light, her every movement touched by a kind of joyous impatience? They dressed simply — she in a flowing skirt, sandals laced up her calves, a soft white blouse that fluttered in the breeze — and set off together, the car winding once more down familiar roads, olive trees flashing silver-green in the sun.

The city welcomed them like an old friend. They wandered through cool galleries where dust motes spun in shafts of golden light, lingered over hand-painted ceramics and antique linens, admired the heavy fragrance of soap shops and the sharp, green scent of the flower market.

By noon, tired and content, they found a shaded terrace and ordered lunch — crisp salads, fresh bread, and sparkling water. The air was thick with the scent of rosemary and grilled meat, the distant sound of a violin rising and falling in the square beyond.

At some point, she excused herself with a kiss on his temple and a soft laugh, disappearing into the café to find the restroom.

Inside, the café was cool and dim. The hallway to the restrooms was narrow, lined with old posters and crooked frames. As she turned the corner, she nearly collided with someone — a solid, masculine presence that smelled faintly of citrus and warm linen.

It was him.

The man from the terrace. The stranger.

For a moment they stood there, close enough that she could see the fine lines around his mouth, the flecks of gray in his beard. His eyes, dark and steady, lingered on her face — then dropped, almost imperceptibly, to the hollow of her throat, the soft line of her collarbone.

"Madame," he said, with a voice low and rich, a slight accent curling around the word like smoke. He stepped aside with an easy smile, a small bow that was somehow both gallant and intimate.

She managed a polite smile, her heart hammering strangely against her ribs, and slipped past him into the restroom.

By the time she returned to the terrace, cheeks flushed, he was nowhere in sight.

She said nothing to her husband — nothing about the brush of that meeting, about the electricity that had snapped between them like a live wire.

Instead, she slipped her hand into his, smiled brightly, and chatted about the paintings they had seen, the lace she had bought, the sweetness of the peaches in the market.

They returned to Saint-Léon in the heavy glow of the late afternoon. The villa welcomed them with the scent of warm stone and lavender, the soft rustle of leaves in the breeze.

Together, they drew a long, luxurious bath, the water perfumed with oils they had found in the city. She leaned back against him, her body relaxed, boneless with contentment, his arms wrapped securely around her. They spoke little, content to simply be — skin against skin, breath against breath.

Later, wrapped in clean sheets, her hair damp and fragrant against the pillow, she fell asleep curled against him, his hand resting lightly on her hip.

And she dreamed.

Dreamed of a hallway lined with crooked frames.
Dreamed of dark eyes that lingered too long.
Dreamed of a bow that was almost a caress, of a voice that wrapped itself around her name like a promise.

When she woke, hours later, the night deep around them, her heart was pounding, and the air tasted of something she could not name.

## Chapter 5

### (The Name of the Stranger)

The flea market was held in a neighboring town, a place slightly larger than Saint-Léon but still caught in that timeless, sun-drunk torpor of southern France. The square was alive with color and clamor — tables heavy with tarnished silverware, faded books, old lace, cracked paintings, rusted tools. The scent of roasting chestnuts floated through the air, mixing with the sharper tang of sun-warmed metal and old paper.

They wandered together, hand in hand, pausing to admire a battered jewelry box here, an ancient map there. She moved with a lightness, a pleasure that radiated from her skin; every so often she would turn to him, her eyes wide with wonder, her laughter easy and bright.

It was almost perfect.

Until she stopped dead in her tracks.

"There he is," she said, her voice low, almost breathless. Her hand tightened on his arm.

He followed her gaze through the jostling crowd.

There — by a stall selling embroidered linens — stood the man.
Casual, composed, speaking easily with the old woman behind the table, his hands moving with a slow, deliberate grace. He wore a simple white shirt rolled up at the sleeves, dark trousers, sunglasses pushed back into his hair. He looked, impossibly, as if he belonged to no one and everywhere all at once.

"He's Albanian," she said suddenly, a bright, almost giddy note in her voice.

He turned to her, eyebrows lifted. "How do you know?"

She hesitated — just for a second, just a flicker — then shrugged, laughing lightly, brushing a hand through her hair. "I don't know. A feeling, maybe. His look... the way he carries himself. You can just tell, can't you?"

He said nothing. But something small and sharp twisted inside him — a thorn of something he refused to name.

She turned back toward the stranger, who was now folding something into a brown paper packet with the vendor. Her excitement was tangible, sparking off her skin.

"Why don't we invite him for a drink?" she said, her voice too casual, her smile a little too bright. "Or even lunch. It would be... interesting, don't you think? To hear about where he's from, his life?"

He hesitated — not from jealousy, not yet — but from a sense that something was changing, slipping quietly out of his grasp.

Still, he smiled. He loved her. He wanted her happiness, her adventure.

"Of course," he said. "Let's see if he’s interested."

Already, she was moving — light on her feet, alive with anticipation — weaving her way through the crowd toward the man who, until now, had been nothing more than a glance, a voice, a dream.

And he followed, feeling the first tremor of something he could no longer quite ignore:
The faint, unshakable certainty that they were stepping across a threshold from which there would be no easy return.

## Chapter 6

### (The Invitation)

The terrace where they found a table was shaded by broad canvas awnings, the heat softened to a lazy, golden warmth. Around them, the town’s flea market carried on — the murmur of bargaining voices, the occasional bark of laughter, the distant clatter of old ironware.

He joined them with an easy smile, accepting the invitation as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Up close, the man seemed even more formidable — not by force of stature, but by the weight of his presence. His movements were unhurried, deliberate, his voice a rich baritone smoothed by the accents of distant shores.

He introduced himself simply: Arban.

No last name. No explanation.

They ordered lunch — fresh salads, olives, thin slices of grilled lamb fragrant with rosemary. Plates were passed, sparkling water poured, and conversation flowed easily at first, light and unthreatening.

Arban spoke English fluently, with a soft accent that curled warmly around the words. Occasionally, he dropped into French when addressing the waiter, shifting between languages with the easy grace of a man who had moved often through the world.

Their talk turned naturally to Albania — to its coastlines, its wild mountains, its proud, wounded history. He spoke of stone towns clinging to cliffs above turquoise seas, of markets heavy with figs and pomegranates, of slow evenings scented with woodsmoke and jasmine.

"One day," she said, eyes shining, leaning forward slightly, "we dream of retiring there. It's so... untouched still. So full of promise."

Arban smiled at her then — not the broad, public smile he had used before, but something smaller, softer. A smile meant for her alone.

"You would be very much at home there," he said. "Beauty is admired, treasured, protected."

She laughed lightly, almost girlishly, and it was then that something shifted further.

At one point, when she complimented his description of Albania, Arban responded with a phrase — not in English or French — but in Polish.

Her face lit up instantly. She answered him without hesitation, a few fluid words tumbling from her lips in that lilting, familiar language.

He chuckled, surprised and delighted, and they exchanged several sentences — casual, playful — while the husband watched, smiling, but with a creeping unease he could not fully name.

She explained, laughing, "Arban has traveled through Poland many times. He says he loves Kraków — the markets, the old streets..."

Arban inclined his head. "And now I see Poland has its most beautiful ambassador right here."

It was flirtatious — just on the edge of propriety — but it was framed in such a way that to object would have seemed ridiculous, petty even.

The lunch lingered sweetly, the day heavy with sun and the scent of rosemary. They spoke of travels, of books, of music, weaving a tapestry of common interests, light and bright as silk.

And yet, in the spaces between words, something darker, slower, more inevitable was beginning to take root.

When asked what had brought him to France, Arban only smiled and said, "Business. Opportunities."
No details. No real answers.
She didn’t seem to notice — or if she did, she brushed it away, charmed and dazzled by the easy confidence he wore like a second skin.

As the plates were cleared, and the afternoon leaned heavily into a golden haze, Arban suggested — almost casually — that they visit him in La Roche, a small village farther inland.

"I have a little place there. Nothing grand. But the river is beautiful. We could take a boat out. Explore the coves. Swim, if you like."

Her eyes lit up immediately. "That sounds wonderful! Doesn't it?" She turned to her husband, her excitement radiating from her.

He hesitated — just for a second — then nodded.

"Of course," he said. "We'd love that."

A plan was made: tomorrow, late morning, by the river's edge.

They parted with warm handshakes and promises, but as they walked back toward their car, he glanced once over his shoulder.

Arban was still there, standing in the shadow of the awning, watching them go.

And though he smiled when he caught the husband's eye, there was something behind that smile — something patient, knowing — that made the heat of the afternoon feel just a little too close, a little too heavy, as if somewhere beyond the market, a storm was already gathering.

## Chapter 7

### (The River and the Dress)

The next morning was bright and clear, the sky scrubbed clean by a cool night breeze. The villa was alive with the scent of brewing coffee, the soft thud of sandals on stone, the faint clatter of bags being packed.

She moved through the rooms with a kind of unthinking grace, humming to herself as she slipped her things into a woven beach bag — a light towel, a bottle of sunscreen, a thin cotton wrap, and at the very bottom, almost hidden, a bikini so small and bright it seemed barely more than a suggestion of clothing.

When she emerged from the bedroom, he looked up — and for a moment, simply stared.

The dress she wore was light, almost sheer, the color of pale champagne. It clung to her hips and floated high against her thighs with every movement, slipping teasingly off one shoulder.
But it was not only the dress that caught him.

It was her face.
The makeup.

Her lips were painted a deep, provocative red, her eyes lined heavily in dark strokes that made them seem larger, more feral. There was a shimmer to her skin, a glow that made her seem almost untouchable — and yet more desirable than ever.

Her hair was pinned up in a loose, elegant style, exposing the long, graceful line of her neck, with a few rebellious strands escaping to frame her face, softening her beauty to something almost unbearably tender.

And when she moved — when she twirled slightly to show him the dress — he saw it.

There was no bra beneath the thin fabric.

The soft, perfect curves of her breasts moved freely under the dress, the faintest suggestion of her nipples visible when she caught the light just right.

He swallowed hard, his body tightening instantly.

But he said nothing.

He loved her too much.
Loved the way she glowed when she felt beautiful, feminine, desired.
Loved the way she seemed to float through the world when she dressed like this, as if she had remembered something precious about herself that everyday life too often asked her to forget.

If this was what made her happy — he thought fiercely — if this brought her joy, then he would not be the man to dim it.

"Do I look good?" she asked, her voice teasing, knowing full well the effect she was having.

"You look..." He struggled for the words. "You look unbelievable."

She laughed — low, sweet, wicked — and crossed the room to kiss him lightly, her perfume wrapping around him like silk.

"This is all for you," she whispered against his ear.

And he believed her.
Even as he knew — deep in the oldest part of himself — that it was not only for him.

Arm in arm, they stepped out into the deepening dusk.

Ahead, the village pulsed with life — music floating on the air, fairy lights strung between trees and lampposts, the scent of roasting meat and sweet pastries curling down the crooked streets.

And somewhere in that crowd, waiting with the patience of a man who knew the game was already his,
Arban was smiling.

## Chapter 8

### (The Sailing Lesson)

La Roche was a scattering of stone houses clustered along the banks of a wide, slow-moving river, the kind that seemed born to carry secrets. The sky was brilliant blue, the sun already high, the cicadas a steady hum in the olive groves beyond.

They found Arban waiting by the river’s edge, his figure broad and relaxed against the sleek lines of a small sailboat moored to a weathered dock.

He greeted them with an ease that felt almost shocking in its intimacy.

First, he took her hands lightly in his, drawing her close, and brushed a kiss against each of her cheeks — light, fleeting, almost formal... and yet not. There was a pause between the kisses, a lingering moment where his mouth hovered just a fraction too near her skin.

Then he turned to the husband, clapping him on the back, pulling him into a rough, cheerful embrace as if they were old comrades reunited after a long absence.

"It’s good," Arban said warmly, his English rich and rolling. "Very good that you came."

The boat was a thing of quiet beauty — a small sloop, its sails neatly furled, the wood gleaming with recent oiling, the lines coiled with a precision that spoke of care and pride. A cooler sat tucked beneath the bench seats, and the air was heavy with the scents of river water, pine resin, and hot stone.

They set off, the sails catching the light breeze with a soft snap. The river opened before them, shimmering and slow, the hills rising green and gold beyond.

For a time, it was perfect.

She lounged against the side of the boat, her bare legs stretched out, her hair a halo of sun-struck gold around her shoulders. Arban steered with lazy confidence, one hand resting lightly on the tiller, his eyes half-closed against the glare.

At some point, he produced a bottle of red wine from the cooler, uncorking it with a small flourish.

"Just a little," he said, smiling as he poured a modest amount into a pair of plastic tumblers. "For the joy of the day."

She hesitated — she almost never drank — but then laughed and accepted the glass, the sunlight catching in the dark liquid as she raised it in a playful toast.

"To adventures," she said.

Their glasses clinked together, and she took a careful sip, wrinkling her nose at first, then laughing again, her cheeks already flushed from the sun.

Later, as the wind picked up slightly and the boat heeled more sharply, Arban suggested she try steering.

"It's easy," he said, grinning. "Come. I’ll show you."

She rose a little unsteadily, giggling, and moved toward him. He shifted to make space, guiding her hips with both hands — firm, familiar — until she was standing between his legs, her hands on the tiller, his arms loosely around her to "steady" her.

The contact was casual — could be casual — and yet it was too much, too long.
The husband's throat tightened as he watched her laugh, her body pressed lightly against Arban's, their voices low, conspiratorial.

Once, Arban leaned in and whispered something in her ear — a few soft words in Polish — and she threw her head back and laughed, a sound so bright and delighted it seemed to ripple out across the water.

The husband asked, lightly, "What did he say?"

She waved a hand dismissively, cheeks flushed. "Nothing. Just... just teasing."

But the look that passed between her and Arban was not nothing.
It was a look full of understanding, of a shared secret too small to name, and too large to ignore.

They sailed like that for hours — drifting lazily with the current, the sun slipping slowly westward, the world reduced to the slow slap of water against the hull and the muted thrum of desire growing quietly, invisibly, beneath the laughter.

## Chapter 9

### (The Swim)

The boat drifted into a small, secluded cove where the river widened and deepened, the banks thick with weeping willows that dipped their branches into the water like long, trembling fingers. The afternoon sun pressed down heavy and golden, the world humming with heat and lazy contentment.

They anchored in the shallows, the hull rocking gently beneath them.

From a basket tucked beneath one of the benches, Arban produced a simple lunch — olives, bread, a wedge of soft cheese, and a handful of bright, plump tomatoes. They ate with their fingers, the food tasting richer and sharper under the open sky.

Afterward, she stretched languidly, wiping her hands on a napkin.

"It's so hot," she said, laughing. "I need to cool off."

Without hesitation, she slipped out of her light dress, revealing the bikini she had hidden in her bag that morning.

It was tiny — two triangles of shimmering blue fabric tied with thin strings that barely seemed to contain her. The cut of the bottoms was indecently high on her hips, revealing long, smooth legs that gleamed in the sunlight.

Arban said nothing — but his gaze lingered for just a heartbeat longer than it should have.

"I think I'll stay here," her husband said, trying to keep his voice light. "Someone has to keep an eye on the boat."

She blew him a teasing kiss over her shoulder and, without waiting, dove into the water with a small, delighted yelp.

Arban followed her easily, slicing into the river with barely a splash.

The husband sat back on the bench, feeling the hot wood beneath him, watching them.

She was not a strong swimmer. She kicked and flailed more than she glided, laughing breathlessly as she tried to stay afloat. Arban was never far from her — always close enough to reach out a steadying hand under her elbow, her waist, the small of her back.

Once, she slipped slightly beneath the surface with a shriek, and he caught her, one arm firm around her ribs, lifting her effortlessly back into the sunlight. She clung to him for a moment longer than necessary, her body pressed against his, her laughter spilling out against his neck.

From the boat, the husband watched, heart pounding with a complicated, sick mixture of arousal, anger, and helplessness.

They swam together like that for a long time — she laughing, splashing, clinging; he steady, patient, always there, always touching.

When they finally climbed back aboard, she was breathless, her hair dripping down her back, her skin glowing with health and heat. Arban helped her up, his hands at her waist, lifting her easily, his fingers slipping just briefly along the curve of her hip.

It was nothing. It could all be explained away.
And yet.

The sun was dipping lower now, gilding the river in molten gold. They packed up in a haze of laughter and sunburnt skin, exchanging warm goodbyes at the dock, promises to meet again soon.

As they drove back toward Saint-Léon, she was quieter, leaning her head against the seat, a small smile playing at the corner of her mouth.

Tomorrow, they knew, was their second-to-last day in this dreamlike place.

And tomorrow night, there would be a party in the town square — an old tradition, with food, music, dancing beneath the stars.

She spoke of it with casual excitement — the music, the food, the lights.

But when he glanced at her, he caught the way her fingers played idly with the edge of her beach bag, the way her smile was just a little too secret.

He understood then, with a hollow certainty:

She already knew Arban would be there.
She had known all along.

## Chapter 10

### (The Party Night)

The morning passed easily, the last full day of their holiday unspooling lazily beneath the southern sun. They wandered hand in hand through the village, exchanging smiles and pleasantries with the locals, admiring the faded shutters, the climbing roses, the simple rhythm of a place untouched by time.

She was vibrant, almost crackling with restless energy — pausing often to admire trinkets in shop windows, chatting animatedly with an old woman selling lavender bundles by the church steps.

He could feel her excitement rising with every hour, could see it in the way she touched his arm more often, in the way her laughter bubbled up too easily.

She was looking forward to the town party.
To the music.
To the lights.
To something more she would not name.

Around six, they returned to the villa to freshen up.

The heat of the day was beginning to fade, replaced by a soft, honeyed glow that turned the stone walls golden. The cicadas slowed their frantic song. Somewhere, a bell rang out the hour.

She disappeared into the bedroom with her makeup case, her jewelry box, her dress folded neatly across the bed like an offering.

He showered quickly, changed, and sat waiting, his heart already beating faster in anticipation.

When she finally emerged, he caught his breath.

She wore the new dress — the ivory one — the fabric clinging lovingly to her curves, skimming high against her thighs, dipping low at the neckline to reveal the delicate shimmer of skin dusted with perfume.
Her hair was pinned up in a loose, elegant style, exposing the long, graceful line of her neck, with a few rebellious strands escaping to frame her face.

And when she moved — when she twirled slightly to show him the dress — he saw it:
There was no bra beneath the thin fabric.
The soft, perfect curves of her breasts moved freely, the faintest suggestion of her nipples visible when the light caught her just right.

Her makeup was heavy again: her lips painted a deep, forbidden red, her eyes dark and smoky, her skin glowing with a shimmer of golden dust.

She shimmered with jewelry: gold layered around her neck, bracelets stacked high on her wrists, rings glittering on both hands. At her ankle, the delicate chain he had given her for her last birthday winked with every step she took.

"Do I look good?" she asked, teasing, knowing full well the effect she was having.

"You look..." He struggled for words. "You look unbelievable."

She smiled — slow, wicked — and kissed him lightly, her perfume wrapping around him like silk.

"This is all for you," she whispered.

And he believed her.
Even as, deep inside, he knew it was not only for him.

Arm in arm, they stepped out into the gathering dusk.

Ahead, the village square had transformed: lights strung overhead, music drifting on the air, the scent of roasting meat and sweet pastries swirling through the crooked streets.

And somewhere, waiting among the dancers,
Arban was already smiling.

## Chapter 11

### (The Whisper in the Crowd)

The town square was a garden of lights and sound.

Strings of golden bulbs crisscrossed the open space, their reflections shimmering in glasses of wine and on the polished surfaces of brass instruments. Long tables groaned under the weight of roasted meats, cheeses, platters of glossy fruit, loaves of warm bread. The music was old and sweet, played on fiddles and accordions, laughter rising high into the velvet night.

She was radiant.

She moved among the villagers with an ease that took his breath away — her laughter bright, her dress swirling around her legs, the gold on her skin catching every flicker of light.

Men turned to watch her pass, their gazes lingering, hungry, admiring.
She accepted their compliments with an open smile, a tilt of her head, a laugh that was not quite flirtatious, not quite innocent.

He watched from a distance, pride and unease twisting together in his chest.

"You are lucky," a voice said beside him.

It was an older man — a local — dressed plainly but with sharp, clever eyes that missed nothing.

"Yes," he said. "I know."

The man sipped his wine, then leaned in slightly, lowering his voice.

"Be careful."

The husband frowned. "Careful?"

The man nodded toward the far side of the square, where Arban stood among a small group, laughing, easy, the center of gravity. Two young women hovered near him, bright-eyed and eager.

"Where he goes," the man said quietly, "beautiful women... disappear."

The words chilled him.

"Disappear?"

The man shrugged. "Not suddenly. Not loudly. But they vanish. With promises."

He glanced sideways, eyes narrowing slightly.

"He invites them. To Albania. To a villa. A life of luxury. A beautiful life."

He paused — and then, almost lazily:

"In exchange... they must work for him. For his friends."

He said no more.
He didn’t need to.

A cold knot twisted itself deep in the husband's gut.

The man smiled — a thin, bitter smile. "Of course, it could be nothing. Just jealousy. It's easy to invent stories when your wife looks at another man the way yours does."

And with that, the man drained his glass and melted back into the crowd.

He stood rooted in place, the laughter and music spinning around him like a world just slightly off-balance.

He looked at her — saw her dancing, laughing, more alive than he'd ever seen her.
And saw Arban, always nearby, always watching.

Thousands of thoughts flooded through him at once.

Was it true?
Was Arban grooming her?
Or was it all just bitter lies?

Should he confront him? Take her away?
Or trust her, trust them, trust the life they had built together?

He didn’t know.

All he knew was that he had never loved her more — and never been more afraid of losing her.

And somewhere among the dancers,
Arban moved closer to her — and she, radiant, laughing, welcomed him.

## Chapter 12

### (The Invitation)

If the night had been made for her, it could not have been more perfect.

The music, the warm velvet darkness, the glittering laughter of the villagers swirling around the square — it all seemed to conspire to make her shine brighter, to lift her above the ordinary world into something almost mythic.

He had never seen her more beautiful.

The way her hair caught the golden light, the way her jewelry shimmered with every graceful movement, the way her smile — wide, unguarded — lit up the faces around her.

She danced often — sometimes with him, her hands light in his, her laughter sweet against his ear. But more often now, with others.

Local men — respectful, admiring — took her hands, led her into the slow, turning rhythms of old romantic dances.
They twirled her gently under the lights, her dress flaring out around her thighs, her anklet flashing at her ankle like a secret.

He watched, heart full, heart breaking, as she surrendered to the music and the night.

And always, somehow, Arban was close.

Not possessive. Not blatant. But there.
Moving easily among the dancers, exchanging laughter and words, always finding his way back near her, brushing lightly against her arm, whispering something that made her blush and laugh.

There was no single moment when it became clear that Arban had her in his grasp.
It was a gradual thing — a slow drawing in, like a tide creeping up the shore — irresistible, inevitable.

And still, he told himself:
She was happy.
Radiant.
Alive.

Could he, in good conscience, steal that from her?

He wrestled with it silently, his body moving through the motions of the party — sipping water, smiling at passing faces — while inside, he was a battlefield of doubts and fears and desperate love.

And then it happened.

They were sitting together at the edge of the square, sharing a plate of sweet pastries, when she turned to him, her face flushed with excitement.

"I have wonderful news," she said, her voice trembling with joy. "Arban has invited us to visit him in Albania!"

She laughed, clapping her hands together softly, her bracelets chiming.

"Can you imagine? Finally seeing it, for real — not just dreaming about it. Maybe even finding a place of our own someday... It's what we've talked about for so long!"

She looked at him with such pure happiness, such innocent longing, that for a moment he could not breathe.

He forced a smile, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.

"That's... wonderful," he managed.

But inside, the questions roared louder than ever.

Was this the beginning of their dream?
Or the beginning of something much darker?

Would he shatter her happiness with suspicion — or lead her into a trap with his silence?

The music rose around them again, a lilting, haunting tune, and the villagers clapped in time, calling the dancers back to the square.

She rose eagerly, holding out her hand to him.

"Come," she said, her eyes sparkling. "Dance with me."

He took her hand — the hand he had held through all the years, through all the storms and the quiet days — and let her pull him into the dance.

And as they moved together under the garlands of lights, he knew the moment of decision was almost upon him.

Almost.

But not yet.

## Chapter 13

### (The Promise)

The villa was quiet again, wrapped in the deep, fragrant darkness of their final night.

The windows stood open to the warm night air, the scent of lavender and old stone drifting through the rooms. Crickets chirred steadily in the gardens, a soft, sleepy chorus.

They sat together on the terrace, sharing the last of the fresh fruit they had bought that morning, a blanket draped loosely over their legs. The party still echoed faintly in the distance — a snatch of music, a burst of laughter — but here, they were alone, wrapped in the cocoon of their memories.

"It’s been wonderful, hasn’t it?" she said, her voice low and full of warmth. She leaned her head against his shoulder, her hair soft against his neck.

"The best holiday we've ever had," he agreed, meaning it with all his heart. And it was true — in so many ways, it had been perfect. A dream come alive under the sun.

She turned her face up to him, her eyes shining in the starlight. "And now... Albania. Can you imagine it? Visiting Arban, seeing the coast, maybe even finding a place of our own someday?"

Her excitement was infectious, her joy so pure it made his chest ache.

He hesitated — only for a breath — then spoke, carefully.

"I know it sounds wonderful," he said gently. "But... do you think we can really trust him?"

She blinked, a little surprised. "Arban?"

He nodded, choosing his words with care. "We hardly know him. He’s charming, yes. Generous. But what if... what if his intentions aren’t what they seem?"

For a moment, disappointment flickered across her face — a shadow passing quickly over the light.

"You think he would lie to us?" she asked, her voice soft, almost hurt. "You think he would..." She shook her head, searching for the right words. "Use us?"

"I don't know," he admitted honestly. "Maybe not. Maybe everything he’s offered is real. Maybe he truly is just a kind man, offering friendship."

He cupped her face in his hands, his thumbs brushing lightly over her cheeks.

"I just don't want to see you hurt," he said. "I don't want us to walk blindly into something we don't understand."

She closed her eyes for a moment, leaning into his touch, breathing him in.

Then she smiled — a small, beautiful smile, full of trust and love.

"You are my husband," she whispered. "My protector. My pillar."

She opened her eyes and met his gaze, fierce and tender at once.

"I trust you. With my life. If you say no, we won't go. If you say something feels wrong, I will listen."

He kissed her forehead, holding her tightly against him, feeling the tremble of his own emotions — love, fear, gratitude — knotting his chest.

They stayed like that for a long time, wrapped in the heavy stillness of the night, the stars wheeling slowly overhead.

And though he said nothing more, deep inside, he knew:

Soon, a choice would come.
And whatever he chose, their lives would never be quite the same again.

Continuing immediately with Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 — next block coming now!
Stay with me — almost there!

## Chapter 14

### (The Last Morning)

The morning of their departure was soft and golden, the air already warm, the village stirring slowly to life.

Suitcases stood packed by the door, the villa stripped back to its bare, familiar bones. They sat together on the terrace, sipping coffee, speaking little, content in the shared silence of an ending.

And then, as if summoned by the thought of him, Arban appeared.

He came around the corner of the stone wall with a slow, easy stride, a bouquet of flowers in his hand — wildflowers and lavender bound with a simple piece of twine — and a bright smile that seemed both genuine and too perfect.

"For the beautiful lady," he said, bowing slightly as he offered the bouquet to her.

She laughed, her cheeks coloring, and accepted the flowers with a murmur of delight, burying her face briefly in their soft scent.

They invited him to sit, and he did, moving with the easy grace of a man who belonged wherever he chose to be.

They shared a last coffee together, speaking of small things — the weather, the drive ahead, the beauty of the river they had sailed just days before. The conversation was light, effortless.

As they finished their cups, Arban rose.

"I thought," he said casually, "before you leave, maybe you would like some fresh croissants from the bakery? They're still warm at this hour."

He turned to the husband. "I can go and bring them. Or..." His smile shifted slightly. "Perhaps the lady would like to choose her favorites herself?"

She laughed, half-rising already, pleased by the idea.

The husband hesitated.

It was only five minutes.
The bakery was just down the street.
Arban's car was parked at the villa — there was no obvious danger.

And yet.

A flicker of doubt, quickly smothered by logic, by trust.

"Of course," he said, forcing a smile. "Go. Pick the best ones."

She beamed at him, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek, and slipped her hand into Arban's offered arm as they turned down the narrow, sunlit street.

He watched them go — watched the way she laughed at something Arban said, the way her body leaned slightly into his — and then they disappeared around the corner.

He sat back, alone on the terrace, the coffee cooling in his cup, the flowers resting against the stone table.

And for the first time, truly alone with the silence, he let the flood of thoughts come.

What were they talking about?
Was Arban weaving his promises now — the villa, the life of luxury, the whispered offers?
Was she laughing innocently, unaware? Or was she listening, heart racing with excitement?

He would ask her, of course.
He would ask him, if necessary — he would confront the man, if it came to that.

But what if it was true?
What if she was already slipping beyond his reach, smiling all the while, not even realizing what was happening?

The minutes dragged by, heavy and slow.

And somewhere deep inside, he knew:

This was not just a farewell.
This was the threshold of a choice that would change everything.

## Chapter 15

### (The Departure)

When they returned from the bakery, it was clear they had enjoyed themselves.

She was flushed and laughing, a paper bag full of still-warm croissants cradled in her arms. Arban walked beside her, easy and relaxed, as if nothing in the world could have touched the simple, golden beauty of that morning.

But they had been gone longer than expected — much longer than a simple trip for pastries should have taken.

He said nothing, masking the tightness in his chest with a smile.

They sat together on the terrace, eating their breakfast while the sun climbed higher in the clear blue sky. She chattered about the bakery, about the little garden they had passed, about a stray cat that had followed them part of the way back.

Afterwards, she rose to pack her last few things, leaving the two men alone together under the fading shadows of the awning.

The moment stretched, thick with unsaid things.

He turned to Arban, fixing him with a steady gaze.

"What's the deal with all the chivalry?" he asked bluntly. "Do I need to be worried?"

Arban smiled — not arrogantly, but thoughtfully, as if the question deserved respect.

He leaned back slightly, considering his answer.

"You," he said slowly, "and especially her, will be fine. Absolutely safe in Albania."

He let the words hang for a moment, then continued, his voice low, almost gentle.

"Like you, I want to see her happy. She has a quality you don't see often in a woman anymore... something pure. Alive."

He smiled again, a little more intimately now.

"You as her husband — you could make her even happier in Albania, you know that. There, life is simpler. Deeper. Real. And she... she could be anything she wants."

The words were vague.
The tone was kind.
But underneath, a darker thread twisted and curled — an implication too subtle to name, too clear to ignore.

Before he could answer, she returned, her bag slung over her shoulder, her hair gleaming in the sunlight.

It was time.

There were kisses on both cheeks, warm hugs, promises to call, to write, to visit. Telephone numbers were exchanged with easy smiles, like old friends parting ways for a little while.

And then they were in the car, driving toward the station, the village receding behind them like the last dream of summer.

The countryside blurred past in a wash of green and gold, but inside the car, the silence was full and soft.

He glanced at her, at the way she watched the passing fields with a small, secret smile playing at her lips.

"Did you enjoy this holiday?" he asked quietly.

She turned her head slowly, her eyes gleaming — brighter, deeper, more alive than he had ever seen them.

She didn’t answer with words.

She only smiled — a smile full of wonder, and maybe a little sadness, and maybe a little excitement — and let her hand slide lightly over his.

He smiled back, heart aching with love, with fear, with a tenderness so sharp it almost hurt.

"Or," he asked, trying to keep his voice light, "are you just glad we're going home?"

She tilted her head slightly, that same unreadable smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.

"Home in Albania?" she asked, her voice soft, filled with infinite possibility.

And for a moment, as the train tracks began to appear in the distance and the sky opened wide above them, he didn't know if she was joking, dreaming — or simply telling him the future.

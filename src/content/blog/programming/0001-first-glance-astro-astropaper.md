Getting up and running quickly with your blog using Astro is a fresh breeze. It made me ðŸ˜„

## Table of contents

## Installing Astro/AstroPaper

Installing Astro using the AstroPaper theme couldn't be easier than running this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template satnaing/astro-paper
```

If you open up the generated project you can immediately see that this theme is well thought out. The posts in the `content` directory explain all the basic things you need to know to start using it right away. To be honest, I haven't read it all but as you can see I felt comfortable writing blog posts and that is what I wanted out of this system.

Tweaking it and making it more my own will come later, I want to focus on getting some content out there but I'm excited to learn more of the capabilities of Astro and this cool theme fo sho! -- And of course, I'll write about that ðŸ˜‰

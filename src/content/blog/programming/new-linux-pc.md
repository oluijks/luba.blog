## Imac died, time for a new system

So, my old beloved 27 inch iMac died. I bought it a few years ago, second hand and it did its job well. So, I wanted a new pc so I found this Dutch company that ships laptops and mini pc's with linux. I ordered the Intel NUC13 Linux Mini-computer with an i5, but when it arrived they mixed up my order with someone from Spain. I called them and they said no problem we will fix it and they were kind enough to upgrade it to a i7, so that was great. It came pre-intalled with Debian (you can choose a distro) but after a few days I switched to Fedora 38.

## My Setup

This is without any doubt the best pc I've ever had. It is small, quiet and performs excellent. I will update this post soon with a photo and some more information of my setup, once I cleaned up my desk ðŸ˜Š

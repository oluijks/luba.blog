## A new side-project

I like building stuff and never finish it: yeah I know I'm that kind of dude... I imagine that is the same for a lot of developers out there but here I am again: announcing my new idea.

About 6 months ago I made a starter project called "Golang Angular Starter", you can find it here: [https://github.com/oluijks/golang-starter](https://github.com/oluijks/golang-starter) and I had a ton of fun making it. Go is a cool language that you can pretty quickly learn and make nice things with it.

My new idea is about the same like the Golang starter but with a different tech stack: Rust for the backend (REST Api: Rapinsel) and SvelteKit for the frontend (Spleen). Perhaps you already guessed it: it's another writing app. But more on that later.

I've been planning to learn Rust for a long time and this project is a nice motivation to actually make my hands dirty, the same goes for Svelte. I've been playing with SvelteKit for a few months now and I feel confidant I can make something cool with this awesome framework. I will also use Postgres to store the data using Docker.

I'll make an seperate blog section where you can read all about the progress and I will take you with me on this little journey.

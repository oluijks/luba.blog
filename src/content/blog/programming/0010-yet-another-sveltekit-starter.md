## About Yass

When starting a new SvelteKit project I tend to configure it in a special way and for the most part use the same packages all the time. Drizzle with SQLite, Lucia Auth, Tailwind CSS and ESLint from @antfu so I decided to make a starter out of it. It's fully open source (MIT License) and I invite you to give it a try, make it your own and if you want improve it, I'm happy to look at your pull request.

### Description

> A modern, feature-rich SvelteKit starter template with authentication, database integration, UI components and deployment configurations ready to go.

- 🔐 Authentication using Auth
- 💾 SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🚀 Production-ready deployment configs

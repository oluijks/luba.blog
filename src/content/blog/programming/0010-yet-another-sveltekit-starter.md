## Yass (Yet Another SvelteKit Starter)

> A modern, feature-rich SvelteKit starter template with authentication, database integration, UI components and deployment configurations ready to go.

When starting a new SvelteKit project I tend to configure it in a special way and for the most part use the same packages all the time. Drizzle with SQLite, Lucia Auth, Tailwind CSS and ESLint from @antfu so I decided to make a starter out of it.

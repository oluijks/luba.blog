description: Moving from GNOME to Hyprland
---

I've been using GNOME for a long time now and I've always been happy with it. It's a great desktop environment and I've never had any major issues with it. However, recently I've been feeling like I want to try something new. I've been hearing a lot of good things about Hyprland, so I decided to give it a try.

I started out searching on YouTube for some videos and one of the first videos I watched was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siy2vL94yd0 which basically is a explanation on his dotfiles to get you up and running with Hyprland. I followed the instructions and installed Hyprland on my pc and boy was I impressed. It's well documented and easy to install, configure and add more plugins if you like.

Visit his repo at https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles and give it a try, the maintainer has put in a lot of work and he deserves a star. It's really easy to install and it looks amazing. I've been using it for a few days now and I'm really happy with it. It's fast, responsive and looks great. I'm definitely going to stick with it for a while.

If you'd like to see how I set up my Hyprland see my own dotfiles:

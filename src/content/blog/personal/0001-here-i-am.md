After some failed attempts to build a nice blog that is easy to use and maintain I am finally here with the help of Astro and AstroPaper theme! So shout out to the Astro team and Sat Naing for making this possible.

## How I got to know Astro

I knew Astro was out there for a while but never gave it any attention. I just thought it was just another framework like so many others that seem to pop up every other month.

The first YouTube video that caught my real interest was with the creator of Astro and ThePrimeagen (you can watch that video here: [Astro 3.0 GETS HTMX?? Creator of Astro Joins!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X71OVbqt614) and that made sense to me in terms of making and maintaining a simple blog website. I know that video talks about htmx but in the back of my mind I was still thinking about the blog I wanted to start.

The failed attempt I talked about in the intro was using markdown files in Angular. Now, don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Angular but for making a blog it is just too much. Another video from ThePrimeagen [WebComponents Will Outlive Your JavaScript Framework | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vF6puwX3bE&t=1529s) convinced me to go with a much simpler system like Astro. I will try out Webcomponents in Astro in the future.

## What are my plans for this blog?

Well, I wanna write about things that I like in life. My wife, my family, my dog, my hobbies, anything worth writing about. Topics like poetry, paleontology, art, programming, movies, music, our Bull Terrier, the Roman Empire, and cosmology to name a few.

Enjoy my blog. Drop me a line if you agree, or disagree on something I wrote, or if you want me to write about something that holds your interest. You can find my contact details on the About Page.

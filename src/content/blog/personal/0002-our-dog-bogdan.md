## Our first Bull Terrier

All my life I wanted a Bull Terrier, I think they are great looking dogs and I just love their clownish behavior. So when my wife Luba and I decided to get a pup we contacted Indian Dogs Kennel in Groningen. Sadly the first pup we wanted died from an infection, so we had to wait for another pup. Finally on november 29 2023 Bogdan was born. January 22 we picked him up.

Here my favourite photos of Bogdan.

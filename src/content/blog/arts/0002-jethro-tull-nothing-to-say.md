description: A song I love - Jethro Tull - Nothing to Say
---

I remember when I was around 10 years old my father had this album and told me the singer also played the flute. He played that record a lot but I don't remember liking the music back then. Until I found this song of Jethro Tull, Nothing to Say and I think it is one of the best songs ever. Funny thing is that I always thought the guy with the flute was named Jethro but it turns out he named his band after a agriculturist from the 17th century.

Listen to this beautiful song on YouTube (the lyrics are breathtaking):

### Nothing to Say

Everyday there's someone asking “What is there to do?”<br />
Should I love or should I fight, is it all the same to you?<br />
No I say I have the answer proven to be true,<br />
But if I were to share it with you,<br />
You would stand to gain and I to lose.<br />
Oh I couldn't bear it so I've got nothing to say.<br />
Nothing to say.<br />

Every morning pressure forming all around my eyes.<br />
Ceilings crash, the walls collapse, broken by the lies<br />
That your misfortune brought upon us and I won't disguise them.<br />
So don't ask me will I explain, I won't even begin to tell you why.<br />
No, just because I have a name well I've got nothing to say.<br />
Nothing to say.<br />

Climb a tower of freedom, paint your own deceiving sign.<br />
It's not my power to criticize or to ask you to be blind<br />
To your own pressing problem and the hate you must unwind.<br />
So ask of me no answer there is none that I could give you wouldn't find.<br />
I went your way ten years ago and I've got nothing to say.<br />
Nothing to say

Hello! I'm Olaf Luijks, a software engineer with a passion for technology, music, and lifelong learning.

## 🎵 Early Life & Musical Journey

I was born in 1973 in Maassluis, a small city in the Netherlands, and spent my formative years immersed in its culture. During my military service, I had the unique opportunity to play in a military orchestra in Germany, Poland and Denmark, an experience that blended structure with creativity and deepened my love for music.

## 💻 How I Got Into Programming

My journey into tech began with a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, a gift from my father. That small machine sparked a fascination with computers that still drives me today. I've been passionate about coding ever since, always eager to learn new languages and explore different paradigms.

These days, I especially enjoy working with JavaScript, Go, and Rust, each offering its own strengths and challenges. I'm also a big-time Linux user, ever since the early days of Slackware. Currently, I'm running Arch Linux, appreciating the control and minimalism it offers.

## 🧑‍💻 Work Experience

I've worked in a variety of environments, from call centers to airlines, and from corporate banks to boutique software companies. A few highlights:

- Call Centers: I started by working with Aspect systems, writing COM objects and automating workflows.
- KPN & ABN AMRO: At KPN, I contributed to the Epiphany project and spent a year working onsite at ABN AMRO.
- Air Transat: I helped build and improve their online booking engine.
- Software Company in The Hague: I spent several rewarding years helping clients solve real-world problems with clean code and pragmatic design.

Right now, I'm studying to become a Security Officer / Ethical Hacker, combining my background in software development with my growing interest in ethical hacking, cybersecurity and governance.

## 🦕 Interests Outside Tech

When I'm not coding or studying, you'll probably find me deep in a book or documentary about dinosaurs or paleo science. The deep history of life on Earth fascinates me, there's something humbling and awe-inspiring about it.

I'm also a lifelong lover of literature and poetry. I especially admire the great French poets, Flaubert, Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Baudelaire, whose language and imagery have long inspired me. Every now and then, I write a poem myself. In fact, I'm currently working on a poetry bundle of my own.

## 🏡 Personal Life

I live in Monster, a peaceful coastal town, together with my wonderful beautiful wife Luba. Our home is always lively when her children come to visit, and our loyal Bull Terrier Bogdan keeps us company (and on our toes).

## 📬 Get in Touch

I'm always open to conversations, collaborations, or just sharing ideas about code, science, or anything in between.

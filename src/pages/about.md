Hi, my name is Olaf, I came into this world in 1973 and grew up for the most part in Maassluis. Did my military service in Germany and Denmark, and I played in a military orchestra. Lived in many places, Zierikzee, Vlissingen, Scharendijke, Ellemeet, Rotterdam, The Hague, and for the last 2 years in Monster, near the beach.

I remember getting a Sinclair ZX Spectrum from my father and I loved playing with that thing, that's how I got hooked on programming. I started working for a call center programming Aspect and later for the same company doing stuff with COM Objects if anyone can even remember those things. Then moved on to KPN as a software engineer for many years primarily working with another company from the USA on a product called Epiphany and being outsourced for a year working for ABM AMRO. Then I worked for 2 years on the booking engine for Air Transat and finally many years for a small software company in The Hague. At the moment I'm trying to finish a study to become a Security Officer.

I'm married to my beautiful Luba and we live in a small house in Monster. A couple of days per week we have her kids over and we have a Bull Terrier called Bogdan.
